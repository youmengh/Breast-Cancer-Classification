# Breast-Cancer-Classification

**About this project:**
- Comparisons of accuracies between different models using the “Breast Cancer Dataset” imported from Kaggle
- Models created include SVM model, decision tree classification, and artificial neural networks
- Keras and Tensorflow libraries were used to build neural network models

**To view the final results open:** **`hin_kumar_breast_cancer_classification.ipynb`**
